# Arduino-pro-micro-macro-pad-5x5
A 5x5 macro-pad/keyboard with two encoders using the Arduino pro micro(atmega32u4).

PARTS:
25x Keys (I used cherry black)
25x Keycaps (I used ones from an old keyboard)
2x Rotary encoder (I used: EC11B152442D)
2x small switches for reset and mode switch
4x m2x10mm screws and nuts (2 may be enough)

STL:

1x Bottom
1x KeyPlate
1x Case
1x wheelBig
1x wheelSmall

Note: 
This is the version so a few mistakes went unnoticed:
- My keyPlate is stiff enough so the extra support colums without holes could be removed.
- The case works but i would redesign it. 
  - The horizontal encoder housing does not work well (I fixed some issues so the STL provided should be better but are untested)
  - I couldn't get the Pro-micro to fit onto the holder. (Bad wiring by me. Fixed some dimensions in Cad but these are also untested.)
  - !! You may want to move the Pro-micro as the cable port is towards the user (I thought a 90Â° cable would allow me to use the keyboard in two directions)
